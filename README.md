# Controll-UKF

## Introduction
Welcome to the Controll-UKF repository! This project is dedicated to implementing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for sensor fusion. The UKF is a powerful tool for state estimation, particularly in non-linear systems, and is widely used in various applications such as robotics, navigation, and tracking systems.

## Features
- **Robust Sensor Fusion**: Leverages the Unscented Kalman Filter to accurately combine data from multiple sensors.
- **Non-linear State Estimation**: Efficiently handles non-linear dynamics and measurements.
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily adaptable to different types of sensors and systems.
